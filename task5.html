                            <p>Natalie Portman is setting the record straight on the concept of method acting for films. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the Academy Award-winning actor shared that she likes to keep her personal life and professional life separate, and that method acting is not something "women can afford."Speaking to The Wall Street Journal, Natalie said, "I've gotten very into roles, but I think it's honestly a luxury that women can't afford. I don't think that children or partners would be very understanding of, you know, me making everyone call me 'Jackie Kennedy' all the time."The actor had talked at length about her preparation for "Black Swan", the film directed by Darren Aronofsky, for which she won the Academy Award. In "Black Swan", Natalie played Nina Sayers, a ballerina whose hallucinations and obsession begin to unfold as she prepares for a major production of Swan Lake. The actor had earlier revealed that she took a year-long rigorous training regimen for the film and that the experience did not leave her even when she returned home.</p>

                            <p>Natalie Portman is setting the record straight on the concept of method acting for films. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the Academy Award-winning actor shared that she likes to keep her personal life and professional life separate, and that method acting is not something "women can afford."Speaking to The Wall Street Journal, Natalie said, "I've gotten very into roles, but I think it's honestly a luxury that women can't afford. I don't think that children or partners would be very understanding of, you know, me making everyone call me 'Jackie Kennedy' all the time."The actor had talked at length about her preparation for "Black Swan", the film directed by Darren Aronofsky, for which she won the Academy Award.

The actor had earlier revealed that she took a year-long rigorous training regimen for the film and that the experience did not leave her even when she returned home.</p>
